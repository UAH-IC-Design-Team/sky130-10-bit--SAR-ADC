## Large End-to-End Batched Tests
The large end-to-end tests were completed using batching on AWS Batch to allow timely completion. Each bit takes about 4 minuetes and 1.5Gbs of memory to calculate, so the tests were separated into small chunks where the input values were iteratively shifted using environment variables. Thus by containerizing the tests, we could run hundreds of docker containers in parallel to complete the simulation quickly. 

The set up for these tests can be found in the [ngspice-batch-runner](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/ngspice-batch-runner) repository.

# Tool Notes

### Xschem
Please start Xschem from the `./xschem` to ensure that the `xschemrc` is sourced.

There is a default test schematic template located `sky130-10-bit-SAR-ADC/xschem/tests/default_template_test.sch`.

### Magic
Please start Magic from the `./mag` directory to ensure that the `.magicrc` file is sourced. 

### Klayout
There are all of the needed Layout Property files and drc files needed in the `./klayout` directory.

### LVS
The Makefile has targets to extract and run lvs with the correct settings and file structure. The comparison output is placed in `./netgen`.

### DRC
Since Magic and Klayout have different DRC rules and solvers, a target in the make file has been provided to run the Klayout DRC check from the commandline and outputs the number of DRC errors. The associated drc marker log can be found in `./klayout/drc_reports`.

To view the Klayout DRC errors, open gds file with the sky130 layer property file. Then go to Tools > Marker Browser and load the DRC marker xml file. 

### Get all the devices used
Use the `get_devices_used` Makefile target to see all of the devices used in the design.

### Xspice
Xspice simulations are not currently functional. Some work neeeds to be done on modifying a flattened schematic netlist and there are odities with Q and dflops.
